# Iteration 3

## Step 2

Perform Analysis of Current Design and Review iteration Goal and Achievement of Design Purpose

The decisions that have been made in iteration 2 provided an initial understanding of the functionality and how it is supported in the system. Also, as part of module identification, we were able to identify a new architectural concern. The design decisions of this iteration were related to the models containing these elements that are listed above and use cases that corresponded to these elements. 
 
## Step 3

The elements that will be refined are the Web Server, and the MySQL Database

## Step 6

We have implemented a refined deployment diagram. All elements have been specified in the Design Decisions category of Step 4. There will also be a sequence diagram to show the interactions between our elements.

## Step 7

The design decisions we made resulted in the creation of the refined deployment diagram and sequence diagram. Adding in these servers and modifying the database made our website structured and more reliable.
