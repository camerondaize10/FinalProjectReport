## Step 3

Website: Watches4You

## Step 4

Web Application

We have selected this design concept as our application is thoroughly web based. Our website consists of a multi-tier architecture, with a presentation, business and data layer. The presentation layer is responsible for managing interactions between the client and browser. The business layer contains information regarding the business logic, which includes the cart system and payment functionality. The data layer contains the modules that manage data that is stored locally or remotely. Therefore, the web application architecture supports our website effectively. 

## Step 5

We have not removed or added any other component to our web application design as those components are required for our application. For our web application the diagram has all the required components and we do not have any other component that is required for our application.
