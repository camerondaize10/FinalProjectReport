Our project is about an e-commerce website called Watches4you. It is a website aimed to sell watches of different kinds to users with an account. After customer selection, they are directed to a checkout page where they can see their Subtotal, Delivery fee, and Total cost. They also have to fill out their valid banking and personal information in order to complete the process. After the customers potentially receive their order, they can also choose to leave a review or feedback depending on their order, or contact us (the developers) directly.
